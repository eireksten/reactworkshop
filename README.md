# Workshop - React.js

We're implementing a simple registration application using React.js!

### Prerequisites
- Install Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
- Install webpack using npm (`npm install -g webpack`)
- Install git (http://git-scm.com/)
- Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/eireksten/reactworkshop.git`)
- Install project dependencies (`npm install`)

### Commands
- Starting the server: `npm start`
